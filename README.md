# DataStructures
Welcome to another edition of Ana's projects!

This project combines Quick sort and Binary Search algorithms. 
The user will input a series of numbers, that will be added to a list of integers. 
Once this list of integers has been sorted in increasing order, the user will then input
the number they wish to search for in their list. 


Input will need to have a last character signifing the end of the numbers you wish to add. 

Sample input: 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Quit

Hope you enjoy!
